🚀 Jenkins CI/CD for Containerized AWS Deployments
(Docker • Terraform • ECR • ECS)

This repository demonstrates production-style CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins to build, push, and deploy Python applications as containers on AWS.

The focus is on modern container workflows, using Terraform, Amazon ECR, and Amazon ECS (Fargate)—not legacy EC2-based deployments.

🧠 What This Repository Covers

✔ Jenkins Declarative Pipelines
✔ Dockerized Python applications
✔ Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
✔ Secure AWS access using IAM Roles
✔ Amazon ECR for container images
✔ Amazon ECS (Fargate) for deployment
✔ Parameter-based Apply / Destroy workflows

🏗️ Supported Deployment Models
1️⃣ Jenkins + Terraform + Docker (Build Stage)

Jenkins builds a Docker image for a Python application

Image is versioned and prepared for deployment

Same Docker image used across environments

Use case: Standardized container builds

2️⃣ Jenkins + Terraform + ECR + ECS (Fargate)

Jenkins builds Docker image

Pushes image to Amazon ECR

Terraform deploys application to Amazon ECS (Fargate)

Jenkins supports Apply / Destroy using parameters

Use case:
✔ Production-grade deployments
✔ Serverless containers (no EC2 management)

🔐 Security Best Practices Used

✅ IAM Roles for Jenkins (no AWS access keys)

✅ No secrets in Jenkinsfile

✅ Terraform .tfvars for environment config

✅ Parameter-based approval (no input() issues)

▶️ Jenkins Pipeline Controls
Deploy Infrastructure & App
Build with Parameters → ACTION=apply

Destroy Infrastructure
Build with Parameters → ACTION=destroy


This approach avoids Jenkins UI deadlocks and is CI/CD friendly.

🧪 Jenkins Patterns Used

Declarative pipelines

Docker build & push

Terraform lifecycle management

Environment isolation using tfvars

Idempotent deployments

🧠 Interview-Ready Summary

“This project demonstrates a Jenkins-driven CI/CD pipeline that builds Docker images, pushes them to Amazon ECR, and deploys containerized applications on Amazon ECS Fargate using Terraform.”

🛠️ Prerequisites
